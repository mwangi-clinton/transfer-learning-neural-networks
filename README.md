# Transfer Learning in Neural Networks with `timm`

## Overview

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning and neural networks that leverages pre-trained models to solve new, but related, problems. Instead of training a neural network from scratch, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, transfer learning allows us to use a model that has already been trained on a large dataset and adapt it to our specific needs. This approach can significantly reduce training time and improve performance, especially when dealing with limited data.

## What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning involves taking a model that has been trained on a source task and fine-tuning it for a target task. The main idea is to utilize the knowledge gained from the source task to improve the performance on the target task. This can be particularly useful when the target task has a smaller dataset or requires specific features that the source task has already learned.

### How Transfer Learning Works

1. **Pre-training**: A model is trained on a large and diverse dataset (source task). This helps the model learn general features and patterns.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The pre-trained model's learned features are used as a starting point for a new task. These features can be used as inputs to a new model or as part of a fine-tuning process.
3. **Fine-tuning**: The model is further trained (fine-tuned) on the target task with a smaller dataset. This involves updating the weights of the model to adapt it to the specific characteristics of the target task.

## Using Transfer Learning with the `timm` Module

This repository demonstrates how to apply transfer learning using the `timm` (PyTorch Image Models) module. The `timm` library provides a collection of pre-trained models and utilities for working with state-of-the-art image models.

### Repository Structure

- **`models/`**: Contains scripts for loading and configuring pre-trained models from the `timm` library.
- **`train.py`**: A script for fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a custom dataset.
- **`data/`**: Example datasets and data loading utilities.
- **`utils/`**: Helper functions and utilities for transfer learning.

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
